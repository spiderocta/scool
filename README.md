# Database-Configuration 

to configure `MYSQL` on AWS please refer to [this manual](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_GettingStarted.CreatingConnecting.MySQL.html) 
and then in `application.properties` add your configurations 
```bash 
spring.datasource.url = your database url
spring.datasource.username = username
spring.datasource.password = password
```

## Deployment
### - Deploying the application to OpenShift or AWS


To deploy the sample application to OpenShift you can use the [OpenShift CLI](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/cli_reference/index.html):

```shell
oc new-app codecentric/springboot-maven3-centos~https://github.com/spiderocta/scool

```

This will create:

* An ImageStream called "springboot-maven3-centos"
* An ImageStream called "scool"
* A BuildConfig called "scool"
* DeploymentConfig called "scool"
* Service called "scool"

If you want to access the app from outside your OpenShift installation, you have to expose the scool service:

```shell
oc expose scool --hostname=www.example.com
```

#### To deploy the sample application to AWS or Container

you can check these links :
* [Deploying on AWS Using AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/deploying-a-spring-boot-application-on-aws-using-aws-elastic-beanstalk/)
* [Deploying a Spring Boot Application - docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/deployment.html)



### maven

Build Spring Boot Project with Maven `mvn install / mvn clean install`

run spring boot using maven : `mvn spring-boot:run`

or load it into your ide then run it. 

access it via local host after configuring the port in properties file . 
``` 
 server.port = <<port number>>
```
